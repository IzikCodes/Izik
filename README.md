# Izik – Portfolio

A workspace shaped with patient hands, built to honor the long line of makers who came before. Here I gather the tools of the modern craft— **React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vite** —to forge a portfolio that is both familiar and forward-leaning. Every component is arranged with care, every flow questioned until it earns its place. It stands as a living map of my journey in web engineering: rooted in tested traditions, yet always reaching for what might come next.

“Code is more than logic — it’s deliberate, elegant, and built to last.”
